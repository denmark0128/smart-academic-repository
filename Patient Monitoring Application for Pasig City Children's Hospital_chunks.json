Degree                      : Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Year                          \n: 2017 Project Description : The purpose of the study was to develop Patient Monitoring Application for Pasig City Childrens Hospital. The application was developed to secure patient information and so the nurses can easily manage patient record in most efficient way their record will no longer on need to be filled in hard copies that occupies space and time. The developer created a database system that will help the reduction of data redundancy to help the management in organizing the records. Report generation can be easily done and would not take a lot of time because everything is kept in a single database."

With the advancement of technology in modern hospital, including its facilities and equipment, people tend to expect more from the hospital as well as its personnel, especially nurses. As such, nurses needs to be specific on time and dosage in referents the needs of the patients. Nurses are also responsible in updating doctors in each patient. This study will help nurses in monitoring the administration of medicines of patients, and nurses schedules. A. Background of the Study Every business in this modern age depends mostly in technology. Nowadays, every hospital aims to have a system that is related to technology in which it uses database. It is very important for the nurse to properly document the management of a patient under his care."

If this information is not documented perfectly, it will cause some data to be misplaced. Pasig City Childrens Hospital was launched on April 8, 2014 and it is located at Kapasigan, Pasig City. The said hospital has a problem in monitoring and managing the information of admitted patients. Based on the interview, hospital has a system wherein they can store the patient record in database, but in monitoring the exact time of medication of patient and recording the vital signs of patient, nurses still use charts and papers. Nurses record all the information in a patient record sheet and transfer the data in a computer system. They spend time in transferring the patients medical record in to the computer system."

With this, we will develop a patient monitoring application for Pasig City Childrens Hospital that will help not just the nurse but also the patient. It will also improve their process in monitoring their patient and to manage properly the patient's information in the hospital. It also allows nurse to easily locate the room number of where the patient is admitted. It will surely allow the nurse to access patients information quickly and securely. B. Objectives of the Study a. General Objective To develop mobile application of patient monitoring for the nurses of Pasig City Children's Hospital. b. Specific Objectives To provide a record module that will automatically handle the patients record. To provide a scheduling module that allows the head nurse to set the time of medication of patient and assigned schedule of nurses."

But efficiency isnt the only benefit. For individual patients, access to good care becomes easier and safer when records can easily be shared. Important information  such as blood type, prescribed drugs, medical conditions and other aspects of our medical history -- can be accounted for much more quickly. At the very least, an existing electronic medical record (EMR) can save time at the doctors office. At most, quick access to our records can be lifesaving if an emergency occurs and answers to those questions are needed during the emergency decision-making process."

    "text": "Hospital Uses Electronic Medical Record According to Sarah Bruyn Jones (2008), unfortunately computerization is talked about as a mantra to solve all medical record problems. It is not. If not done methodically and in a phased manner it can create more problems. Because of this, a national push to bring medical records up to speed with rapid advancements in information technology has doctors trading their pens for keyboards. Hospitals and physicians offices are feeling pressure from the government and the medical industry to switch from paper charts to electronic health records. Promises of improved patient care are luring some, but many are lagging behind, citing sometimes prohibitive costs. Besides the cost of the hardware and software, physicians often incur high costs for installing and setting up the new record-keeping system. Often, smaller practices, where staff are busy caring for patients, have to hire outside consultants that guide them into the digital age."

Critics wonder if medical providers should have to incur the cost, when the beneficiaries are often the patients and insurance companies or the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid. Electronic Patient Records According to Washington (2009), many feel that digital record keeping has advantages over paper filling, due to the deceased risk of medical error, and increased levels of efficiency. Those who side with ancient way of doing things, say that electronic record keeping causes problems because many doctors are unfamiliar with new technology. The cost is also very high to convert paper filling to electronic filling, another disadvantage to research system. The study found that up to 98% of U.S. hospitals are still using paper methods of keeping charts, while 2% of hospitals are operating digitally."

There have been continual increases in IT spending among hospitals over the last several years, and as IT system proliferate, hospitals are generating an incredible amount of raw clinical, financial and operational external public security, are creating a growing imperative for hospitals to harness these raw data to improve their performance across a variety of dimensions. Medication Reminder Synchronization System According to Park et al the study of medication reminder synchronization system based on data synchronization. It transmits OMA (open mobile alliance) DS (data synchronization) based messages containing the patients medication data and the device configuration data to a remote manager/medical staff. It also synchronizes data (including medication schedules) modified/generated by these personnel in the medication server."

With recent technologies we are able to carry out remote monitoring of psychological parameters in patients. This allows communication between a patient and medical personnel using a smartphone, which will collect, analyze, and transfer heart rate and oxygen saturation data for subsequent review by a medical professional. Before any on-line analysis is performed on the phone it is necessary to clarify the nature of the correlation between these medical parameters. In the current thesis they established connection between a patients wearing a pulse-oximeter and a smart phone running Android and perform continuous data collection."
