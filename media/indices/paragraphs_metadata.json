Introduction \n \nAs time progresses, the crucial role of pet feed shops in meeting the diverse dietary needs of animals \nremains unwavering. Pet feed shops are not only thriving but also evolving with the assistance of \nadvancements in modern technology like using online platforms, as well as the shifting of preferences of \nconsumers. According to Hanjaya, M. et.al. (2019), nowadays, the purchasing behavior from the consumers \nin the retailing industry has changed and it has been considered as a noteworthy directional change from \nphysical stores buying behavior to web based acquiring behavior. With this transition, the focus on accuracy \nand efficiency in online shops has become even more noticeable. Every order placed by the owner and \ndelivered to consumers is an important transaction that reflects not only the product quality but also the \nestablishment's dependability and professionalism. \nMachine learning continues to show itself as a tool for tackling complex issues and creating \ninnovation in other sectors. Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are a machine learning technique that \nstands out as a remarkable development in the field of artificial intelligence.  This machine learning is a \nclass of artificial networks which have emerged as a dominant in numerous computer vision applications \nthat sparks interest across diverse industries. Designed to autonomously and flexibly learn spatial \nhierarchies of features through backpropagation, CNNs utilize a series of building blocks including \nconvolutional layers, pooling layer, and fully connected layer (Yamashita,R., et. al., 2018).  Convolutional \nneural networks (CNN) are the foundation of computer vision systems that are increasingly being used in \nanimal-related sectors to improve animal management techniques.

The Pet Feed Volume Counter is the application being \ndeveloped or studied, which simplifies the process of measuring or counting specific orders and includes \ninventory sorting for pet feeds. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model \nused in image recognition and processing, is the main tool used to develop the pet feed volume counter. \nSuperworms are the specific type of pet feed being studied, and their characteristics could affect how the \nCNN performs. Lastly, Superworms.PH refers to the context or scope of the study, indicating a specific \ncompany. These main concepts guide the research questions and objectives of the study. Moreover, the \nstudy seeks to streamline the order and inventory process of pet feeds, specifically superworms, by \nemploying a convolutional neural network for image recognition.

This study not only explains the complexities of object counting but \nalso opens the door for creative solutions to deal with a range of problems in various industries. \n \nAlthough the field of object counting is well-established, Huberman-Spiegelglas et al.

Their method addresses situations where \nobjects repeat within an image in contrast to traditional object counting which frequently involves numerous \ndifferent types of objects and possibly large quantities. The study's active learning approach to weakly-\nsupervised learning is its strongest point. This allows the network to achieve good results with minimal \nlabeled data, a significant advantage for single-object counting where extensive annotation can be time-\nconsuming. Also, by examining the internal representations of the network, they are able to pinpoint \ninformative data points during active learning which may result in counting that is both quicker and more \nprecise. However, it's important to consider limitations. The approach might not apply well to situations \nwith different objects, different quantities, or overlapping objects, which are frequent difficulties in more \ncomprehensive object counting tasks.

This describes the overall strategy, the specific procedures followed, conditions, \nand the layout of the system. The methodology is designed to make the system precise, fast, and stable in \nreal-world conditions. The main focus of this is on the building of a system with the application of CNN, \nleveraging its ability to learn and recognize intricate patterns in high-resolution images of the superworms. \nThe procedures include the specification of hardware and software requirements, data gathering processes, \nand the design of the CNN model. To validate the system’s performance and reliability, verification and \ntesting is discussed here. \n \nH. General Method Used \nCNNs are a popular choice for image recognition tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical \nfeatures from raw pixel data. They consist of convolutional layers that automatically learn relevant features \nfrom input images. CNNs excel at capturing spatial hierarchies and local patterns in images. For superworm \ndetection, CNNs can learn to recognize distinctive features (such as body shape, color, and texture) that \ndifferentiate superworms from other objects. Using CNNs aligns with the topic because they provide an \neffective way to analyze superworm images and count their occurrences. The convolutional layer detects \npatterns within subregions of the input image using receptive fields (also known as filters or kernels). It \nslides the receptive field across the input volume, performing element-wise multiplications and summing \nup the results to produce feature maps. Convolutional layers learn local features (such as edges, textures, \nand shapes) from the input data. Convolutional layers can have multiple filters, each capturing different \nfeatures.

It does this by downsampling the feature maps, typically through operations \nlike max pooling or average pooling, which take the maximum or average value within small regions of the \nfeature maps. \nFully Connected Layer: In this layer, the feature maps are flattened into a vector and connected to a \ntraditional neural network structure. This allows the network to learn high-level features and make \npredictions based on the features extracted from the previous layers. The fully connected layer is typically \nfollowed by an output layer, which produces the final predictions of the CNN. \n \nPython"

High-resolution cameras, with specifications such as 1080p or 4K \nresolution, are strategically placed at pet feed stations to capture detailed images or video footage of \nsuperworms behavior. These cameras effectively capture the number of superworms present in a container. \nConsiderations related to color and background play a crucial role in image accuracy. Superworms, being \nthe primary focus, may share similar color depth with the background, potentially affecting the accuracy of \nimages captured by cameras. To address this, you can employ techniques such as background subtraction \nto isolate superworms from the background. Additionally, color normalization can help adjust for variations \ncaused by lighting conditions. By comprehensively analyzing visual data while considering the presence \nand characteristics of superworms in the storage environment, you can enhance the accuracy and reliability \nof your pet feed volume counting system implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). \n \nDefine Object Categories \nIn this case study the specific object that will be the main subject is superworms, also known as \nZophobas morio larvae, are the primary objects of interest.

This supports Pasig City’s goal of becoming more eco-friendly through the \n“Pasig Green City” program (Ohmyhome, 2023). However, one major challenge is \nthe spread of plant diseases. Many gardeners, especially beginners, find it hard to \ndetect early signs of disease. They often rely on manual checking, which is \ntime-consuming, inaccurate, and usually done too late when the plant is already \ndamaged (Singh et al., 2022). \nTo address this, the study will develop a mobile application called SmartLeaf \nthat uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect diseased plants in real \ntime. CNN is a deep learning method that can analyze images and detect patterns \nagriculture (Pacal et al., 2024). The app allows users to simply take a photo of a \nplant to check if it is healthy or not. This solution is affordable and user-friendly, \nmaking it accessible to local gardeners who may not have technical knowledge or \nexpensive equipment (Siddiqua et al., 2022). The goal is to provide a faster, simpler, \nand more accurate way to detect diseased plants and support the urban gardening \ncommunity in Barangay Santo Tomas. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this study is to develop a mobile-based application called \nSmartLeaf that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect whether a \nplant is healthy or diseased based on images of its leaves.

Each model was evaluated to see how well it \nperforms in classifying these conditions. \n \nTable: Performance Results of each model. \n \nCNN-Sequential \n \nMobileNetV2 \n \nResNet50 \nTable: Confusion Matrix of each model. \nBased on the performance results, MobileNetV2 is the best choice for SmartLeaf \ndue to its highest accuracy (98.48%) and strong F1-scores (98% healthy, 99% \ndiseased). While CNN-Sequential is the fastest, it has low accuracy, making it less \nideal for diseased plants detection. \nResNet50 has good accuracy but is significantly slower (~14.2980 ms) and has the \nlargest file size (~93.61 MB), making it impractical for mobile use. \nMobileNetV2 is lightweight (~11.05 MB) and fast, ensuring efficient real-time \ndetection on mobile devices."

    "text": "Discussion \nAmong the models tested, MobileNetV2 emerged as the most suitable for the \nSmartLeaf application because it balances accuracy, inference speed, and storage \nefficiency. Since the goal is real-time detection on mobile devices, MobileNetV2’s \ncompact size ensures that it runs smoothly without straining resources. \n \nPractical Considerations \n●​ Storage Efficiency: MobileNetV2 is significantly smaller (~11 MB) compared \nto CNN-Sequential (~84 MB) and ResNet50 (~93 MB), making it ideal for \nphones with limited storage. \n●​ Real-Time Performance: The inference speed of MobileNetV2 (~7.3616 ms) \nensures rapid diseased plant detection, which is crucial for urban gardeners \nwho need immediate results. \n●​ Reducing False Diagnoses: The high F1-score minimizes false positives \nand false negatives, ensuring that gardeners receive reliable diagnoses \nwithout frequent errors. \n \nThe deployment of SmartLeaf powered by MobileNetV2 can greatly support local \nurban gardening efforts in Barangay Santo Tomas, allowing gardeners to: \n●​ Reduce plant loss by detecting diseased plants early. \n●​ Improve productivity with faster and more accurate plant health \nassessments. \n●​ Encourage tech-based sustainable gardening in urban spaces. \nWhile MobileNetV2 performs well, future improvements could focus on handling \nvarying image conditions, such as low lighting or complex backgrounds. Additionally, \nexploring offline functionality would make SmartLeaf even more accessible to \ncommunities with limited internet connectivity. \nThis study successfully demonstrates that CNN-based  \ndiseased plant \ndetection can improve urban gardening. After evaluating three CNN architectures, \nMobileNetV2 proved to be the most effective, combining high accuracy, fast \ninference time, and minimal storage requirements.

    "text": "Dataset \nThe dataset used in this study is solely based on the publicly available \nPlantVillage dataset by roboflow, containing labeled images of healthy and diseased \nplant leaves. No data was collected directly from Barangay Sto. Tomas; however, \ntesting of the developed model was focused on serving the urban gardening \ncommunity in that area to evaluate its effectiveness and responsiveness. The \ndataset was divided into 2 classes: healthy and diseased leaves (generalized). In \npreprocessing, the images were resized to fit the model input requirements. \nNormalization was also applied to scale up the images. Along with these set-ups, \ndata augmentation such as rotations and brightness of the image are also \nconsidered.  \nComparison of Algorithms \nThis case study used three different CNN architectures, which include \nCNN-Sequential, a simple CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers with \ndropout; it serves as a baseline lightweight model trained from scratch. ResNet50, a \ndeep 50-layer pretrained residual network using frozen layers for transfer learning; \nthis aims for higher accuracy and better generalization with less training. And \nMobileNetV2, a lightweight, efficient pre-trained model optimized for mobile use with \ndepthwise separable convolutions; it balances accuracy and speed for real-time \ndeployment. All the models use Keras, a high-level deep learning API that simplifies \nthe process of building deep neural networks, and are capable of utilizing CNN \narchitectures, to determine what is the best and most effective machine learning \nmodel to use for the study. \nTraining Environment \nAll models in this study were developed and trained using Python with Keras built on \nTensorFlow as the deep learning framework. Supporting libraries such as OpenCV \nand NumPy were used for image processing, while Matplotlib and scikit-learn were \nused for performance visualization and metric evaluation.

These are the key \nconsiderations for efficiently planning the development of a building project. \nHowever, in a construction project, an estimate of the funds needed to \ncomplete a construction project from start to finish, including all related \nexpenditures and expenses incurred during the building process, is called a \nconstruction budget. Even though the budget aims to predict every expense \nassociated with a construction project, one should allow for contingencies to cover \nunforeseen building expenditures or crises (Peter, 2024)."

One can \nmake sure the project is finished on schedule and within the allocated budget by \nestablishing a reasonable budget, selecting the best team, utilizing nearby \nresources, and steering clear of typical financial hazards. It should be kept in mind \nthat every peso saved brings one step closer to a building project's success (JCO \nConstruction, 2024). \n \nAccording to Forbes and Taylor (2024), construction budget is the total \nestimated cost of a project, typically broken out into cost codes based on the scope \nof work and specifications. It embodies a practical approach in construction by \nbalancing incoming funds with the outflow of expenditures. \n \nAdditionally, the construction budget estimates project expenses, including \nlabor, materials, equipment, and overhead costs. But more importantly, it helps to \ncontrol costs, maintain positive client relationships, and provide clear expectations \nfor everyone involved in the project (Quickbase, 2024). \nDebbie (2023), stated that construction budgeting is important to the \nbuilding process, no matter the size of the construction company or the scope of \nthe project involved. Not only does budgeting help builders stay on track financially, \nit also helps save administrative and construction time in the long run, which leads \nto savings in project costs. An accurate and detailed construction budget not only \nhelps ensure current jobs are profitable, it helps ensure builders can take on more \njobs in the future."

According to Jermias et al. (2023), \ncompanies in Uganda used budgetary control to identify possible risks, analyze \neach to determine the degree of risks, and compare it against their tolerance, and \neventually develop a plan to prevent such risks, then monitor for possible \nimprovements. They also focused on cash flow risks as it could restrict their \noperations if their cash flow becomes at risk. \nA way other companies found useful was to incorporate digital \ntransformation through data analytics. Ebhota et al. (2024) stated that a significant \nimprovement was observed reciprocally in incorporating digital transformation and \nbudgetary control processes as well as customer satisfaction. Furthermore, \naccording to Bergmann et al. (2020), the use of business analytics in the budgeting \nprocess has a positive impact on the satisfaction of users and consumers. \nAccording to ProPM (2023), budget planning and control in construction \nprojects is a critical element to the success of the project.

The observed difference suggests that corporations may \nimplement stronger or more structured budgetary control practices compared to \nsole proprietorships. The t-test yielded a test statistic of 2.026 and a p-value of \n0.029, indicating that the difference between the two groups was statistically \nsignificant at the 5% significance level (p < 0.05). \nThese results suggest that the type of business organization has a meaningful \nimpact on budgetary control practices. Corporations, likely benefiting from more \nformalized structures, larger resources, and possibly regulatory requirements, \ndemonstrate a higher degree of budgetary discipline. In contrast, sole \nproprietorships, which may operate with more flexibility but fewer formalized \nprocesses, show comparatively weaker budgetary control practices. \nIt is important to note that the assumption of equal variances was maintained \nbased on prior checks. While the findings provide evidence of a significant \ndifference, the effect size and practical implications should also be considered. \nThe relatively small standard deviation for corporations (0.23) indicates less \nvariability in budgetary control practices among this group, potentially reflecting \nconsistent adherence to structured practices. Conversely, the larger standard \ndeviation for sole proprietorships (0.53) suggests greater variability, which could \nbe attributed to differences in scale, resources, or managerial expertise."

    "text": "Introduction \nWater litter has become a rising global concern, threatening ecosystems and \nbiodiversity. Common water pollutants are based on land-based and ocean-based \nsources. These sources are namely the improper disposal of wastes, runoff from \nagricultural and industrial areas, and illegal dumping. This issue narrows down to the \ndensely populated cities of Metro Manila. Pasig City, known as the Green City, is one of \nthe greatest contributors of waste pollution. This also goes down to the arteries of the \ncommunities like canals, dikes, and creeks. This research develops a web-based system \nusing advanced machine learning models to quantify and identify surface water litter in \nPasig City's waterways. The paper analyzes these models. \nPurpose \nThis study develops an automated system, using machine learning, to identify and \nquantify surface water macrolitter. It implements and compares three models—YOLOv8, \nSSD, and Faster R-CNN—for litter detection. The objectives of the study are as follows:  \nI.​\nTo evaluate the performance of selected algorithms based on specific criteria such \nas time complexity, model performance, and efficiency. \nII.​\nTo compare and contrast multiple algorithms to determine their strengths and \nweaknesses in solving a particular problem. \nIII.​\nTo identify the most suitable algorithm for a given application or dataset.  \n Comparison of Machine  \nThis \nfigure \nprovides \na \ncomprehensive \ncomparison of YOLOv8, SSD, and FCNN \nacross various object detection metrics. It \nincludes mean Average Precision (mAP) at two \nthresholds, training time per epoch, and specific \nlosses for both bounding box and class \nprediction. Additionally, the figure presents Precision and Recall charts, illustrating each \nmodel's effectiveness in identifying objects while minimizing false alarms."

    "text": "Discussion \nIn choosing the most suitable object detection algorithm, we carried out a detailed \ncomparison of SSD, FCNN, and YOLOv8, focusing on key performance metrics like mean \nAverage Precision (mAP), loss reduction, precision, recall, and training efficiency. The \nresults clearly pointed to YOLOv8 as the top performer, offering an excellent balance \nbetween accuracy and computational practicality. It consistently outperformed the others \nin both mAP at 50 percent and the more challenging mAP at 50 to 95 percent, while SSD \nlagged behind with relatively stagnant accuracy. FCNN showed strong mAP scores as \nwell, but its high accuracy came at a steep cost—training time per epoch increased \ndramatically, making it less feasible for large-scale or time-sensitive projects. \nIn contrast, YOLOv8 showed a much more efficient learning curve, with quicker \nand more consistent reductions in both box and class loss during training—something \nSSD could not match. It also struck a solid balance between precision and recall, doing a \nbetter job of minimizing false positives while reliably identifying true objects. When it came \nto training time, YOLOv8 kept things manageable with a steady, linear increase, whereas \nFCNN’s time demands increased rapidly and SSD, although faster, never quite delivered \nthe accuracy needed. \nOverall, YOLOv8 offered the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. Its \nconsistent accuracy, fast convergence, and reasonable computational requirements make \nit an ideal fit for our needs, effectively balancing strong detection capabilities with practical \nusability \nReferences \nJuras, E.

    "text": "1.0 Introduction  \nThe development of deep learning has particularly enhanced the effectiveness of facial \nrecognition technologies. This case study will focus on the advancement of three pioneering \nworks in facial recognition convolutional neural networks (CNN): FaceNet, VGG, and \nInception-ResNet V2.  \nFaceNet maps face images into a high-dimensional concept space where the distance of \nvectors indicates similarity, and was used for comparing facial similarity. This is done \nby training a neural network on millions of face images, and then using the model to predict \nfeatures for a full face to build a representation (Schroff, F. et al., 2015). The layered structure of \nVGG resulted in deep specialization, thereby improving accuracy in facial recognition and \nidentification, which now includes gender classification and emotion detection, enhancing the \nscope of its application in multimodal biometric systems (Rabea, M. et al., 2024). In the field of \nface recognition, Inception-ResNet-V2 is known for creating highly accurate and robust facial \nembeddings. This high-performance convolutional neural network employs residual connections \nalongside Inception modules for enhanced accuracy in detail classification such as delineating \nframes of features on the face. \nThe case study aims to analyze these models' efficiency in facial recognition considering \ntheir accuracy, computational effectiveness, and usefulness. The researchers want to identify the \nmost effective method for integrating deep learning-based facial recognition into practical \nsystems by comparing their strengths and limitations. \n2.0 Purpose of the Study \nThe purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of three widely recognized \nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models—FaceNet, VGG, and Inception-ResNet V2—to \nevaluate their efficiency, accuracy, and computational effectiveness in facial recognition tasks."

The results are expected to provide developers, researchers, and \nsystem integrators with suggestions on which type(s) of CNN-based model will be more suitable \nfor efficient and reliable face recognition across different applications. \n \n3.0 Comparison of Algorithms and Discussion  \nThe study uses three different models: FaceNet, Inception-ResNet v2, and VGG-19. \nThree different CNN models with differing algorithms. FaceNet uses an algorithm that generates \nhigh-quality face mapping with machine-learning architectures, Inception-ResNet v2 is almost \nthe same as Inception using the two 3x3 convolutions and incorporates the use of residual \nconnections instead of the concatenation part usually seen in the Inception architecture, and \nVGG-19 that uses with 19 weight layers comprised with 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully \nconnected layers.  \n \nUsing the Confusion Matrix, the FaceNet model achieved the highest performance with \naccuracy, macro average, and weighted average of 99% in precision, recall, and f1-score. \nVGG-19 reached an accuracy, macro average, and weighted average of 28%, 27%, and 27% \nrespectively on all metrics.

As learning environments evolve, so too do the \nchallenges students encounter—one of the most prominent being academic \nburnout. While technology has improved educational access and efficiency, it has \nalso contributed to an “always-on” culture that can increase emotional strain. \nBased on the article by Salmela-Aro and Upadyaya (2020), modern students are \nfrequently caught in an imbalanced cycle of high academic demands and limited \npersonal resources, which often leads to disengagement and emotional \nexhaustion. \n    Several studies have highlighted the increasing levels of psychological stress \namong students. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, has worsened these \nissues by combining health fears with increased academic workloads. According \nto Portoghese et al. (2020), this has significantly amplified symptoms of burnout, \noften resulting in mental health deterioration and academic decline. Traditionally, \nburnout detection relied on interviews and surveys, which are subjective and \noften too slow to flag early symptoms. As Aslan, Ochnik, and Çınar (2020) \npointed out, traditional tools may miss the subtle behavioral signs that signal a \nstudent is nearing burnout."

As learning environments evolve, so too do the \nchallenges students encounter—one of the most prominent being academic \nburnout. While technology has improved educational access and efficiency, it has \nalso contributed to an “always-on” culture that can increase emotional strain. \nBased on the article by Salmela-Aro and Upadyaya (2020), modern students are \nfrequently caught in an imbalanced cycle of high academic demands and limited \npersonal resources, which often leads to disengagement and emotional \nexhaustion. \n    Several studies have highlighted the increasing levels of psychological stress \namong students. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, has worsened these \nissues by combining health fears with increased academic workloads. According \nto Portoghese et al. (2020), this has significantly amplified symptoms of burnout, \noften resulting in mental health deterioration and academic decline. Traditionally, \nburnout detection relied on interviews and surveys, which are subjective and \noften too slow to flag early symptoms.
