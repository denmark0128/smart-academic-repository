A human has many\nsenses which can be expanded further depending on how the sensory system is\nclassified starting from 5 senses (Visual, Auditory, Somatosensory, Olfactory, and\nGustatory) based on the sensory cells; and up to 20 senses if based on the\nspecialized cell types, what signals perceived. The Visual followed by the\nAuditory sense is the most important sense as they are the most used senses\nmaking people reliant on them (AGEI Educational Team, 2022), many use these\nsenses without a thought as it is used with the majority of actions from\ncomplicated actions such as processing information to the mundane tasks like\nentertainment, by adhering to the senses is what creates Ambience or\nAtmosphere.\nUsing ambiance is prominent when it comes to businesses as by\nimplementing it, the customer experience is increased therefore also increasing\ncustomer satisfaction which correlates to a high spend per customer (Morse,\n2023). Ambiance is also present in the entertainment field. In movies, sounds\ncan accentuate the tone that is trying to portray in the film. This is displayed in\nhorror movies where the atmosphere is that it makes use of stagnant sounds and\nvisuals which can elicit a sense of foreboding\n1 of 58"

The use of ambiance in films not only increases the\ncinematic narrative of the film but also the perception, engagement, and\nImmersion of the audience (Dobrev, 2020).\nContrary to popular belief, Machine Learning or just commonly known as\n“ML” is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Consumption was also associated with a \nlower risk of several specific cancers and neurological, \nmetabolic, and liver conditions. Harmful associations \nwere largely nullified by adequate adjustment for \nsmoking, except in pregnancy, where high versus \nlow/no consumption was associated with low birth \nweight (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval \n1.03 to 1.67), preterm birth in the first (1.22, 1.00 to \n1.49) and second (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22) trimester, and \npregnancy loss (1.46, 1.06 to 1.99). There was also \nan association between coffee drinking and risk of \nfracture in women but not in men.\nCONCLUSION\nCoffee consumption seems generally safe within usual \nlevels of intake, with summary estimates indicating \nlargest risk reduction for various health outcomes at \nthree to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit \nhealth than harm. Robust randomised controlled \ntrials are needed to understand whether the observed \nassociations are causal. Importantly, outside of \npregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee \ncould be tested as an intervention without significant \nrisk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of \nfracture should possibly be excluded.\nIntroduction\nCoffee is one of the most commonly consumed \nbeverages worldwide.1 As such, even small individual \nhealth effects could be important on a population \nscale. There have been mixed conclusions as to \nwhether coffee consumption is beneficial or harmful \nto health, and this varies between outcomes.2 Roasted \ncoffee is a complex mixture of over 1000 bioactive \ncompounds,3 some with potentially therapeutic \nantioxidant, \nanti-inflammatory, \nantifibrotic, \nor \nanticancer effects that provide biological plausibility \nfor recent epidemiological associations.

Statistically, \nthe odds ratio is similar to the relative risk when the \noutcome is uncommon114 but will always be more \nextreme.114 Similarly, for rare events, relative rates \nand hazard ratios are similar to the relative risk \nwhen censoring is uncommon or evenly distributed \nbetween exposed and unexposed groups.114 Many \nmeta-analyses stated their assumption but included \ninsufficient information to allow us to judge the \nsuitability of the pooling. Notably, only one meta-\nanalysis produced a summary statistic with hazard \nratios.53 We did not downgrade the AMSTAR score \nwhen this assumption had been made, and we did \nnot downgrade meta-analyses for failing to consider \nuncertainty in variance estimates as this was \nuniversally unstated.115 Furthermore, the computation \nof dose-response meta-analyses should use methods \nthat account for lack of independence in comparisons \n(same unexposed group), such as those proposed by \nGreenland and Longnecker.116 Reassuringly, most \ndose-response meta-analyses we included in our \nsummary tables cited this method.\nMost of the studies we included were meta-analyses \nof observational studies.

To evaluate the quality \nof evidence, potential biases, and validity of all \nstudies available on dietary sugar intake and any \nhealth outcomes, we did an umbrella review of meta-\nanalyses on this topic.\nMethods\nUmbrella review methods\nWe systematically searched, extracted, and analysed \nlarge amounts of data from published systematic \nreviews \nand \nmeta-analyses \nthat \nresearch \nthe \nassociations between various health outcomes and \ndietary sugar consumption.39 40 Generally, dietary \nsugar consumption could be measured through the \nspecific proportions of sugars in foods or a percentage \nof total energy and combined in meta-analyses.3 \nTherefore, we excluded simple systematic reviews \nwithout meta-analyses from our umbrella review. \nWe prospectively registered this umbrella review in \nPROSPERO \n(CRD42022300982) \n(https://www.crd.\nyork.ac.uk/PROSPERO/).\nLiterature search\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and \nthe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from \ninception through January 2022 (last update) for \nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised \ncontrolled trials and observational studies.

Furthermore, the types of sugar \nsweetened beverages and dosage of their consumption \nvaried in the original studies. In this umbrella review, \nmost meta-analyses produced summary effects from \noriginal studies that measured exposure to dietary \nsugars through the number of servings a day. However, \nin some original studies, the number of millilitres a day, \ngrams a day, times a day, times a week, times a month, \nservings a week, or servings a month were used to \nestimate sugar consumption, which may partly explain \nthe origin of heterogeneity in meta-analyses. Therefore, \ndose-response analysis and stratification analysis \nby sugar sweetened beverage types were unavailable \nfor most outcomes owing to diverse measurements \nof sugar sweetened beverage consumption in the \noriginal studies.

Evidence for the harmful \nassociations between dietary sugar consumption and \nchanges in body weight (sugar sweetened beverages), \nectopic fat accumulation (added sugars), obesity in \nchildren (sugar sweetened beverages), coronary heart \ndisease (sugar sweetened beverages), and depression \n(sugar sweetened beverages) seems to be more \nreliable than that for other outcomes. Evidence of the \nassociation between dietary sugar consumption and \ncancer remains limited but warrants further research. \nIn combination with the WHO and WCRF/AICR \nrecommendations and our findings, we recommend \nreducing the consumption of free sugars or added \nsugars to below 25 g/day (approximately six teaspoons \na day) and limiting the consumption of sugar \nsweetened beverages to less than one serving a week \n(approximately 200-355 mL/week).38 119 To change \nsugar consumption patterns, especially for children \nand adolescents, a combination of widespread public \nhealth education and policies worldwide is urgently \nneeded.\nWe thank Nanxi Yan for her linguistic assistance during the \npreparation and revision of this manuscript.\nContributors: YH, ZYC, BC, and, JZL are joint first authors and \ncontributed equally to this work.

Hanley, Deepak Kumar, Zakir Durumeric\nStanford University\nhhanley@stanford.edu, kumarde@stanford.edu, zakird@stanford.edu\nAbstract\nIn the buildup to and in the weeks following the Russian Fed-\neration’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state media outlets out-\nput torrents of misleading and outright false information. In\nthis work, we study this coordinated information campaign\nin order to understand the most prominent state media narra-\ntives touted by the Russian government to English-speaking\naudiences. To do this, we first perform sentence-level topic\nanalysis using the large-language model MPNet on articles\npublished by ten different pro-Russian propaganda websites\nincluding the new Russian “fact-checking” website waron-\nfakes.com. Within this ecosystem, we show that smaller web-\nsites like katehon.com were highly effective at publishing\ntopics that were later echoed by other Russian sites. After an-\nalyzing this set of Russian information narratives, we then\nanalyze their correspondence with narratives and topics of\ndiscussion on r/Russia and 10 other political subreddits.\nUsing MPNet and a semantic search algorithm, we map these\nsubreddits’ comments to the set of topics extracted from our\nset of Russian websites, finding that 39.6% of r/Russia\ncomments corresponded to narratives from pro-Russian pro-\npaganda websites compared to 8.86% on r/politics.\n1\nIntroduction\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation invaded\nUkraine. As reported by NBC News, in the weeks leading\nup to the war and in the days following the invasion, Rus-\nsian disinformation campaigns targeting Ukraine and blam-\ning the “West” for heightening tensions increased dramat-\nically (Abbruzzese 2022).

Narratives ranged from the de-\nbunked idea that the US was funding biological weapons re-\nsearch in Ukraine to the claim that Russia waged the war\nto “demilitarize and denazify” Ukraine. As a result of this\ntorrent of disinformation, the United Kingdom and the Eu-\nropean Union banned Russian media companies like Rus-\nsia Today (M 2022; Chee 2022). On March 1, due to the\nvast amounts of disinformation, Reddit even took the ex-\ntraordinary step of quarantining the r/Russia subred-\ndit (Yeo 2022). This quarantine amounted to publicly label-\ning r/Russia as containing disinformation and requiring\nusers to acknowledge this before accessing the subreddit.\nHowever, despite the prevalence of this type of disinfor-\nmation online, the research community still lacks program-\nCopyright © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

Topic modeling tools\nlike LDA fall short in mapping topics across platforms (Min\net al. 2015), and keyword-based approaches often rely on\npre-existing expert knowledge of disinformation campaigns,\nwhich often cannot be distilled at the speed at which infor-\nmation campaigns are deployed (Bal et al. 2020).\nTo address these limitations, in this paper, we vali-\ndate and utilize a sentence-level topic analysis methodol-\nogy to identify and map the spread of Russian state me-\ndia narratives across news sites and social media.

In the past decade,\nhowever, the amount of disinformation spread by the\nRussian Federation has increased substantially (Hellman\nand Wagnsson 2017). Due to this increase, as well as\nRussian interference in the 2016 US Presidential elec-\ntions (Badawy et al. 2019), there have been multiple\nstudies of Russian-spread disinformation on social media\nplatforms. For example, Badawy et al. studied the effect\nof Russian government-linked misinformation bots and\ntrolls on Twitter (Badawy, Ferrara, and Lerman 2018).\nSimilarly, Golovchenko et al. found that a large majority of\nthe message on Twitter promoting pro-Russian narratives\nsurrounding events in Ukraine belonged to ostensibly\nnon-state-sponsored accounts (Golovchenko, Hartmann,\nand Adler-Nissen 2018).\nIn addition to studies on the spread of Russian disinforma-\ntion on social media, several other works have documented\nthe general spread of news misinformation on social media.\nMost similar to our work, Guo et al. attempted to link tweets\nto news articles using text-to-text correlations (Guo et al.\n2013). While unable to handle synonyms and perform larger\ntopic correlations between articles, their approach largely\ninforms our own.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),\na Bayesian probabilistic model used to assign topics to doc-\numents, is one of the most commonly used methodologies\nfor extracting topics (Jelodar et al. 2019). In their work, Al-\nbalawi et al. show that LDA is one of the most effective\nmethodologies among various computationally light alter-\nnatives (e.g., LSA, LDA, NMF, PCA, RP) proposed within\nthe last decade based on metrics of recall and precision of\ntopics for short text data (Albalawi, Yeap, and Benyoucef\n2020). However, due to the problem of sparsity in word co-\noccurrences, LDA often falls short. Qiang et al. discuss the\npositives and negatives of many topic modeling approaches,\nhighlighting LDA’s shortcomings (Qiang et al. 2020).\nSeveral recent works have shown the usefulness of word\nembeddings in improving LDA-based approaches. Find-\ning LDA unable to deal with large vocabularies, Dieng\net al. extend LDA by building topics directly from word-\nembedding spaces (Dieng, Ruiz, and Blei 2020).

    "text": "Topic Extraction and Analysis\nTo extract topics and higher-level semantic meaning from\nour documents and comments, we rely on recent advance-\nments in contextual word embeddings (Huang et al. 2021;\nDevlin et al. 2018; Song et al. 2020). Notably, these ad-\nvancements allow text with similar meanings, when mapped\nto a given embedding space, to have similar embed-\ndings. Our work leverages these advancements to build a\nsemantically-rich embedding space for sentences from Rus-\nsian state media websites, to cluster these sentences into nar-\nrative/topic clusters, and to finally extract topics from these\nclusters. We note that our approach relies on each embed-\nding belonging to only one cluster, and thus to one topic. We\nthus rely on sentence-level topic analysis in this work. Our\nintuition is that while articles often contain multiple topics,\nsentences individually tend to discuss one topic and thus can\nbe more accurately placed into only one topic/narrative clus-\nter. Figure 2 shows each step of our pipeline. We detail each\nstep below:\nExtracting Sentence-Level Embeddings\nThe first step of\nour topic modeling pipeline leverages a fine-tuned version of\nMPNet (Song et al. 2020), which is a 768-dimensional con-\ntextual word embedding model released by Microsoft Re-\nsearch.

The specific model version we\nuse is fine-tuned to the semantic search task, which aims to\nfind documents that relate to one other (Guha, McCool, and\nMiller 2003).\nTo prepare each article for input to MPNet for topic\nanalysis, we utilize the Python Natural Language\nToolkit/nltk library’s sentence tokenizer to segment\nthe articles into their individual sentences (Loper and Bird\n2002).

We further remove all special characters, hyperlinks,\nand non-English words.\nForming Topic/Narrative Clusters\nAfter extracting each\nsentence-level embedding, we create “narrative clusters” by\nclustering similar sentences. To do this, we first perform di-\nmensionality reduction using the UMAP algorithm (Becht\net al. 2019), which reduces the dimensionality of our embed-\ndings from 768 to 5. We perform this dimensionality reduc-\ntion to avoid the “curse of dimensionality” that makes it dif-\nficult to identify dense clusters or perform nearest neighbor\nsearches in high-dimensional spaces at a reasonable compu-\ntational cost (Marimont and Shapiro 1979). We then clus-\nter our set of embedding using hierarchical density-based\nclustering, namely HDBSCAN (McInnes, Healy, and Astels\n2017). We note that HDBSCAN is useful to our methodol-\nogy as it allows us to identify clusters of arbitrary size. Fur-\nthermore, HDBSCAN allows us to identify topics without\nus pre-defining the number of clusters, enabling us to find\nthe “naturally” occurring dense narrative groupings within\nour dataset (Zannettou et al. 2018).\nHDBSCAN is conservative, assigning sentences and\nembeddings\nto\na\ncluster\nonly\nwhen\nconfidence\nis\nhigh (McInnes, Healy, and Astels 2017).

A major aspect of Russia’s claim that Ukraine\nrequired “denazification” was that the Azov battalion\nvolunteer force was a key part of Ukraine’s military. The\nAzov Battalion is a para-military group launched by the\nultranationalist group ”Patriot of Ukraine” and the extremist\ngroup “Social-National Assembly” in 2014. Many, includ-\ning the US government and the Ukrainian government, have\nattempted to moderate the group (Raghavan et al. 2022). Af-\nter being reorganized under the National Guard of Ukraine\nand after an effort in 2017, however, the Azov battalion has\nlargely been considered to be depoliticized (Shekhovtsov\n2020). Furthermore, despite the call from Vladimir Putin to\n“denazify” Ukraine, Ukraine’s current president Volodymyr\nZelensky is Jewish (Troianovski 2022). Further, while anti-\nsemitism remains a problem in Ukraine, according to polls\nconducted in 2016 by the Pew Research Center, Ukraine has\nsome of the lowest rates of anti-Semitic attitudes in Eastern\nEurope (Masci 2018). We find that several websites in our\ndataset have written extensively about the Azov battalion\nwith 29 Tass and 21 Russian Today articles mentioning the\nneed to “denazify” Ukraine.\n4https://web.archive.org/web/20220412213821/https:\n//tass.com/defense/1417951\nWar on Fakes Website\nStarting on March 4, 2022, waronfakes.com began utilizing\n“fact-checking” tactics to spread disinformation concerning\nthe Russo-Ukrainian War (Figure 1).

As seen in Table 4, in\nparticular, we find that five articles have mentions of bio-\nlogical weapons funded by the United States and four have\nmentions of “misinformation in the reporting” of Ukrainian\nevacuations of different cities. We note, however, that these\ntopics are not the largest on the website.\nOne of the largest topics on waronfakes.com, mentioned\nby 58 articles, is the “spread of misinformation by Ukraini-\nans” on Telegram and social media. As part of its “fact-\nfinding” mission, the website in various articles cites how\nUkrainians are spreading lies about the Russian atrocities\noccurring in Ukraine. For example, on March 28, waron-\nfakes.com “fact-checked” a rumor spreading on Telegram\nthat the Russian military had destroyed a food depot.5 Sim-\nilarly, in response to information online about how the Rus-\nsian military had burned a village down, waronfakes.com\nwrote an article denying it.6 Along these same lines, another\none of the largest topics, containing 16 articles concerns\ncorrecting information about Russian destroyed buildings\nin Ukraine. A third topic with 15 articles discussed West-\nern propaganda. This illustrates the extent to which waron-\nfakes.com has targeted social media and Western media out-\nlets in its “fact-finding” mission.\n5\nRussian State Media Narratives on Reddit\nIn this section, we examine how the narratives spread by\nour set of Russian state media websites interact with so-\ncial media, specifically, the r/Russia subreddit.

In contrast, various\nother subreddits have much lower percentages of comments\nassociated with narratives from Russian state media sites.\nr/politics, one of the largest subreddits discussing pol-\nitics, has only 8.86%, a far cry from 39.6% in r/Russia.\nWe leave identifying the set of all subreddits that have ele-\nvated levels of narratives associated with Russian state me-\ndia websites to future work.\nFinally, to illustrate our methodology’s ability to uncover\nand track disinformation, we track two disinformation narra-\ntives, US-funded Ukrainian bioweapons and elevated levels\nof Nazism within Ukraine, spread by Russian state media\non each of these subreddits (detailed in Section 4). As seen\nin Table 9, r/politics despite the lower percentage of\ncomments associated with Russian disinformation, with the\nlargest number of comments mapped, it has the largest abso-\nlute number of comments about both disinformation narra-\ntives. We find (we hypothesize due to the heavy moderation\nof r/Russia) that the r/Russia subreddit overall does\nnot contain an outsized presence of these disinformation nar-\nratives.\n6\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation invaded\nUkraine with the stated goal to “demilitarize and denaz-\nify” the country. In this work, we utilize a fine-tuned ver-\nsion of the large language model MPNet to understand\nthe narratives being spread by Russian state media web-\nsites surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine and their\npresence on the r/Russia subreddit. We discover that\nsmaller websites like katehon.com, strategic-culture.org,\nnews-front.info, and geopolitica.ru had an outsized effect"

    "text": "proach can be used to identify and understand the presence\nof specific Russian promoted narratives on Reddit. A large\ninsight of this approach relies on the idea of using sentence-\nlevel topics. Ordinarily, topic modeling cannot be effectively\ncomputed on a sentence level due to word co-occurrence\nsparsity. To avoid this issue, we exploit large language mod-\nels’ ability to extract semantically rich embeddings (Song\net al. 2020). With our approach, we successfully tracked\nReddit comments within the r/Russia subreddit without\nrelying on keywords or hyperlinks. We note that other ways\nof performing tracking such as utilizing keywords require a\npriori knowledge of specific disinformation narratives and\ncan bias the results. This ability is part of what drives our\napproach’s use of MPNet and BERTopic rather than LDA.\nUsing the later approach to assign comments to topics would\nconfine our work to matching keywords that occurred within\nclusters to keywords that occurred within comments. Ap-\nproaches, built for document-level topic analysis like LDA\nfurther also assume that documents contain multiple topics;\nfor social media posts like Reddit comments, this is largely\nnot the case. Because the dictionaries between social me-\ndia and news websites can radically differ despite discussing\nsimilar topics and due to LDA’s breakdown on smaller texts,\nLDA is largely unsatisfactory for our purposes.\nFuture Work\nOur work can be extended to track and\ntrace propaganda and media narratives across social media.\nBy automatically identifying the set of promoted narratives\npresent on a given website using clustering and then us-\ning these clusters to find similar narratives across sites like\nReddit and Twitter, our approach can be utilized to under-\nstand the scale of influence of different ideas (disinformation\nor otherwise) across the Internet.
